# Labyrinth Generator

This code computes a random labyrinth and displays it in a window.  
When the first window is closed, another one will be displayed with the solution of the labyrinth.  


The code is not optimal but works well for labyrinths under a size of 50.  


Run `./install.sh` to install python3, tkinter and numpy.  
Run `./lauch.sh` to start the program.
